# Rock Paper Scissors

Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors. The classic game that all of us are familiar with. But if you are even slightly confused here are the basic rules.
- It is played by two players
- Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.
- If both players choose the same options, the game ends in a tie.

Thats it! Those are the basic simple rules. But, don't worry, the game won't be as simple. The CPU would not just randomly throw rock, paper or scissors, It will act according to how you play and try to beat you in the best way possible. So have fun and enjoy the game.
